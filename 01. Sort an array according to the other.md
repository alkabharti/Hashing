## Sort an array according to the other :

Given two integer arrays A1[ ] and A2[ ] of size N and M respectively. Sort the first array A1[ ] such that all the relative positions of the elements in the first array are the same as the elements in the second array A2[ ].
See example for better understanding.
Note: If elements are repeated in the second array, consider their first occurance only.
